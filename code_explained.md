This script is a **Streamlit app** that helps a user find a group of people with similar interests by using a clustering model. Let‚Äôs break it down step by step.

---

### **General Idea**

* The app loads a **pretrained clustering model** (PyCaret).

* It takes **user input** (age, education, favorite animals, favorite places, gender).

* The model predicts which **cluster (group)** the user belongs to.

* It shows:

  * The **cluster‚Äôs name and description** (from a JSON file).

  * The **distribution of people** in the same cluster (age, education, animals, places, gender).

In short: it‚Äôs a **"find your group" recommender app**.

---

### **Main Steps**

1. **Imports & Setup**

   * Uses `streamlit` for the web UI.

   * `pandas` for data handling.

   * `pycaret.clustering` to load a model and predict cluster assignments.

   * `plotly.express` for interactive charts.

   * JSON for loading cluster descriptions.

MODEL\_NAME \= 'welcome\_survey\_clustering\_pipeline\_v1'  
DATA \= 'welcome\_survey\_simple\_v1.csv'  
CLUSTER\_NAMES\_AND\_DESCRIPTIONS \= 'welcome\_survey\_cluster\_names\_and\_descriptions\_v1.json'

2. **Helper Functions with Caching**

   * `get_model()` ‚Üí loads the saved clustering model once.

   * `get_cluster_names_and_descriptions()` ‚Üí loads cluster labels & explanations from JSON.

   * `get_all_participants()` ‚Üí loads dataset of all survey participants, adds their predicted clusters.

3. These are wrapped with `@st.cache_data`, so results don‚Äôt reload every time the app refreshes.

3. **User Input Form (Sidebar)**

   * Sidebar asks the user about themselves:

     * Age group

     * Education level

     * Favorite animals

     * Favorite place

     * Gender

   * Creates a **DataFrame (`person_df`)** with that single user‚Äôs info.

person\_df \= pd.DataFrame(\[{  
    'age': age,  
    'edu\_level': edu\_level,  
    'fav\_animals': fav\_animals,  
    'fav\_place': fav\_place,  
    'gender': gender,  
}\])

4.

4. **Model Prediction**

   * Loads the model and dataset of all participants.

Predicts the **user‚Äôs cluster**:

 predicted\_cluster\_id \= predict\_model(model, data=person\_df)\["Cluster"\].values\[0\]

*   
  * Looks up **name & description** of that cluster from the JSON file.

---

5. **Display User‚Äôs Cluster**

Shows cluster name \+ description:

 st.header(f"Najbli≈ºej Ci do grupy {predicted\_cluster\_data\['name'\]}")  
st.markdown(predicted\_cluster\_data\['description'\])

*   
  * Shows how many participants belong to that cluster (`st.metric`).

---

6. **Visualizations of Group**

Filters dataset to participants in the same cluster:

 same\_cluster\_df \= all\_df\[all\_df\["Cluster"\] \== predicted\_cluster\_id\]

*   
  * Creates histograms with Plotly:

    * Age distribution

    * Education distribution

    * Favorite animals

    * Favorite places

    * Gender

7. Each histogram is interactive and shows how the group is composed.

---

### **In Summary**

* **Backend:** Loads a clustering model \+ dataset.

* **Input:** Collects user survey responses.

* **Prediction:** Finds the user‚Äôs cluster.

* **Output:** Shows group name, description, size, and demographics with interactive charts.

üëâ It‚Äôs basically an **interactive clustering-based survey app** that helps users see where they ‚Äúfit in‚Äù compared to others.

Do you want me to also **draw a flowchart** of the app‚Äôs workflow so it‚Äôs even clearer?
